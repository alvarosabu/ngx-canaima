* Ready to go build system using Webpack for working with TypeScript.
* Ahead of Time (AoT) compile for rapid page loads of your production builds.
* Tree shaking to automatically remove unused code from your production bundle.
* [Webpack DLLs](https://robertknight.github.io/posts/webpack-dll-plugins/) dramatically speed your development builds.
* Testing Angular 4 code with Jasmine and Karma.
* Coverage with Istanbul and Karma
* End-to-end Angular 4 code using Protractor.
* Type manager with @types
* Hot Module Replacement with Webpack and [@angularclass/hmr](https://github.com/angularclass/angular2-hmr) and [@angularclass/hmr-loader](https://github.com/angularclass/angular2-hmr-loader)

### Quick start
**Make sure you have Node version >= 5.0 and NPM >= 3**


# install the repo with npm
```npm install```

# start the server
```npm start```

# use Hot Module Replacement
```npm run server:dev:hmr```


## File Structure
We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class. Here's how it looks:
```
angulab/

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:
* `node` and `npm` (`brew install node`)
* Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v4.x.x`+ (or `v5.x.x`) and NPM `3.x.x`+

> If you have `nvm` installed, which is highly recommended (`brew install nvm`) you can do a `nvm install --lts && nvm use` in `$` to run with the latest Node LTS. You can also have this `zsh` done for you [automatically](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#calling-nvm-use-automatically-in-a-directory-with-a-nvmrc-file) 

Once you have those, you should install these globals with `npm install --global`:
* `webpack` (`npm install --global webpack`)
* `webpack-dev-server` (`npm install --global webpack-dev-server`)
* `karma` (`npm install --global karma-cli`)
* `protractor` (`npm install --global protractor`)
* `typescript` (`npm install --global typescript`)

## Installing
* `fork` this repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install webpack-dev-server rimraf webpack -g` to install required global dependencies
* `npm install` to install all dependencies or `yarn`
* `npm run server` to start the dev server in another tab

## Running the app
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm run server` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:2690` (or if you prefer IPv6, if you're using `express` server, then it's `http://[::1]:2690/`).

### server
```bash
# development
npm run server
# production
npm run build:prod
npm run server:prod
```

## Deploying

### Build files
```bash
# development
npm run build:dev
# production (jit)
npm run build:prod
```

* Create API credentials that have sufficient permissions to S3. More info
  [here](https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website/tree/master/additional-docs/setting-up-aws-credentials.md).
* Go to your website directory
* Run `s3_website cfg create`. This generates a configuration file called `s3_website.yml`.
* Set the site: option to `site: dist`
* Put your AWS credentials and the S3 bucket name into the file
* Run `s3_website cfg apply`. This will configure your bucket to function as an
  S3 website. If the bucket does not exist, the command will create it for you.
* Run `s3_website push` to push your website to S3. Congratulations! You are live.
* At any later time when you would like to synchronise your local website with
  the S3 website, simply run `s3_website push` again.
  (It will calculate the difference, update the changed files,
  upload the new files and delete the obsolete files.)

## Other commands

### build files
```bash
# development
npm run build:dev
# production (jit)
npm run build:prod
# AoT
npm run build:aot
```

### hot module replacement
```bash
npm run server:dev:hmr
```

### watch and build files
```bash
npm run watch
```

### run unit tests
```bash
npm run test
```

### watch and run our tests
```bash
npm run watch:test
```

### run end-to-end tests
```bash
# update Webdriver (optional, done automatically by postinstall script)
npm run webdriver:update
# this will start a test server and launch Protractor
npm run e2e
```

### continuous integration (run unit tests and e2e tests together)
```bash
# this will test both your JIT and AoT builds
npm run ci
```

### run Protractor's elementExplorer (for end-to-end)
```bash
npm run e2e:live
```

### build Docker
```bash
npm run build:docker
```

# Configuration
Configuration files live in `config/` we are currently using webpack, karma, and protractor for different stages of your application

# AoT Don'ts
The following are some things that will make AoT compile fail.

- Don’t use require statements for your templates or styles, use styleUrls and templateUrls, the angular2-template-loader plugin will change it to require at build time.
- Don’t use default exports.
- Don’t use `form.controls.controlName`, use `form.get(‘controlName’)`
- Don’t use `control.errors?.someError`, use `control.hasError(‘someError’)`
- Don’t use functions in your providers, routes or declarations, export a function and then reference that function name
- @Inputs, @Outputs, View or Content Child(ren), Hostbindings, and any field you use from the template or annotate for Angular should be public

# External Stylesheets
Any stylesheets (Sass or CSS) placed in the `src/styles` directory and imported into your project will automatically be compiled into an external `.css` and embedded in your production builds.

For example to use Bootstrap as an external stylesheet:
1) Create a `styles.scss` file (name doesn't matter) in the `src/styles` directory.
2) `npm install` the version of Boostrap you want.
3) In `styles.scss` add `@import 'bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.scss';`
4) In `src/app/app.module.ts` add underneath the other import statements: `import '../styles/styles.scss';`

# Contributing
You can include more examples as components but they must introduce a new concept such as `Home` component (separate folders), and Todo (services). I'll accept pretty much everything so feel free to open a Pull-Request

# TypeScript
> To take full advantage of TypeScript with autocomplete you would have to install it globally and use an editor with the correct TypeScript plugins.

## Use latest TypeScript compiler
TypeScript 2.1.x includes everything you need. Make sure to upgrade, even if you installed TypeScript previously.

```
npm install --global typescript
```

## Use a TypeScript-aware editor
We have good experience using these editors:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm 10](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)

### Visual Studio Code + Debugger for Chrome
> Install [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) and see docs for instructions to launch Chrome 

The included `.vscode` automatically connects to the webpack development server on port `7682`.

# Types
> When you include a module that doesn't include Type Definitions inside of the module you can include external Type Definitions with @types

i.e, to have youtube api support, run this command in terminal: 
```shell
npm i @types/youtube @types/gapi @types/gapi.youtube
``` 
In some cases where your code editor doesn't support Typescript 2 yet or these types weren't listed in ```tsconfig.json```, add these to **"src/custom-typings.d.ts"** to make peace with the compile check: 
```es6
import '@types/gapi.youtube';
import '@types/gapi';
import '@types/youtube';
```

## Custom Type Definitions
When including 3rd party modules you also need to include the type definition for the module
if they don't provide one within the module. You can try to install it with @types

```
npm install @types/node
npm install @types/lodash
```

If you can't find the type definition in the registry we can make an ambient definition in
this file for now. For example

```typescript
declare module "my-module" {
  export function doesSomething(value: string): string;
}
```


If you're prototyping and you will fix the types later you can also declare it as type any

```typescript
declare var assert: any;
declare var _: any;
declare var $: any;
```

If you're importing a module that uses Node.js modules which are CommonJS you need to import as

```typescript
import * as _ from 'lodash';
```
